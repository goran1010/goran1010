Hello there, I'm Goran Jović.

Programmer, full-stack web developer, open-source enjoyer, and all-around decent guy.

I've been building apps using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as React and Tailwind on the front end.  
On the back end, I mainly work with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and Prisma.

Meanwhile, I do my best to contribute to open-source and enjoy the communities they foster.

These days, I'm planning a new project where I’ll be utilizing and learning TypeScript as I go - and after working with relational databases, I’m exploring the non-relational world of MongoDB.
